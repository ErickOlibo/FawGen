/// - Note:
///     - The length is the character count of the generated madeUpWord.
///     It must be within the boundaries of the minMaxLength constant.
///     - The algo is the algorithm used to create the madeUpword and goes from 1.0 to 5.0.
/// - Remark: Each quality is optional, meaning that if nil is chosen, the
/// quality requirement will be dismissed (as in set to false)
